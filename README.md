# Fast caustic design: A fast high contrast freeform optics designer based on OTMap

## Examples

#### Ring:
![ring simulation](data/ring_sim.png)

```
./caustic_design -res 512 -focal_l 1.5 -thickness 0.2 -width 1 -in_src -in_src ../data/source.png -in_trg ../data/ring.png
```

#### Einstein:
![einstein simulation](data/einstein_sim.png)

```
./caustic_design -res 512 -focal_l 1.5 -thickness 0.3 -width 1 -in_src -in_src ../data/source.png -in_trg ../data/einstein.png
```

## Installation

This code uses [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org), Surface_mesh, and CImg that are already included in the repo/archive.
The only libraries you need to install are [Ceres Solver](http://ceres-solver.org/) for the normal integration and libpng/libjpg for image IO.

It is however highly recommended to install [SuiteSparse/Cholmod](http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/suitesparse.html) for higher performance.

All you need is to clone the repo, configure a build directory with cmake, and then build.
For instance:

````
$ git clone ...
$ cd fast_caustic_design
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make -j8
````
